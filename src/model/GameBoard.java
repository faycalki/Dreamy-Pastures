/**
 * This class contains a List of List of ITokens called BoardList. Serves as the Main Game Board for the game.
 *
 * @implSpec Each List in BoardList may or may not contain an IToken. The GameBoardView can access this Board and pre-process it so that the GameBoardView can output it appropriately.
 * This GameBoard will always be of size 10.
 * This class also contains the Dream Tile Array, which can also be revealed in the GameBoardView in conjunction with the boardList's contents.
 * The Dream Tile Array will also contain Zzz tokens inside it. Those should also be processed and drawn by the GameBoardView.
